## Instructions

## Design and implement a solution to the following task, with the following requirements in mind

-  The solution should be clear, concise, efficient and maintainable.
-  Provide an abstracted solution that demonstrates an understanding of business logic and presentation separation
-  Do not make use of any libraries that are not part of the standard language libraries.

You are of course free to use whatever resources or references that are available to you, but it is expected that the design/solution will be 100% your own.

Your solution should be accessible through online revision control and source code management (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc). Don't rush it. No extra marks for getting it done quickly.

## Task
Create	a	Flickr	image	gallery	using	PHP.	The	user	should	be	able	to	enter	a	keyword,	which	is	then	used	to	search Flickr.	The	search	results	should	be	paginated	and	displayed	as	five	results	per	page,	and	the	user	should	be	able	to	navigate to	other	pages.	Each	image	should	be	displayed	as	a	thumbnail;	clicking	on	the	thumbnail	should	display	the	full-size	image	and	any	abstract	or	title.	Keep	in	mind	that	your	solution	should	work	efficiently,	no	matter	how	many	images	match	the	keyword.

## Hint: Extra points for implementation of any of the following:
   - git flow
   - flexible configuration
   - unit testing
   - automation

## Note
This is an opportunity for you to showcase your skills and knowledge of good programming practices and methodologies. This is a backend test, therefore presentation is not a priority(JS, CSS).
